Description: Spatial statistical modeling and prediction for data on stream networks, including models based on in-stream distance (Ver Hoef, J.M. and Peterson, E.E., 2010. <DOI:10.1198/jasa.2009.ap08248>.) Models are created using moving average constructions. Spatial linear models, including explanatory variables, can be fit with (restricted) maximum likelihood.  Mapping and other graphical functions are included.
