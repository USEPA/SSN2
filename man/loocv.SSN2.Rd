\title{Perform leave-one-out cross validation}
\usage{
\method{loocv}{ssn_lm}(object, cv_predict = FALSE, se.fit = FALSE, ...)

\method{loocv}{ssn_glm}(object, cv_predict = FALSE, se.fit = FALSE, ...)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{A fitted model object from \code{\link[=ssn_lm]{ssn_lm()}} or \code{\link[=ssn_glm]{ssn_glm()}}.}

\item{cv_predict}{A logical indicating whether the leave-one-out fitted values
should be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{se.fit}{A logical indicating whether the leave-one-out
prediction standard errors should be returned. Defaults to \code{FALSE}.}

\item{...}{Other arguments. Not used (needed for generic consistency).}
}
\value{
If \code{cv_predict = FALSE} and \code{se.fit = FALSE},
a tibble indicating several
leave-one-out cross validation error metrics. If \code{cv_predict = TRUE} or \code{se.fit = TRUE},
a list with elements: \code{stats}, a tibble indicating several
leave-one-out cross validation metrics; \code{cv_predict}, a numeric vector
with leave-one-out predictions for each observation (if \code{cv_predict = TRUE});
and \code{se.fit}, a numeric vector with leave-one-out prediction standard
errors for each observation (if \code{se.fit = TRUE}).

If an \code{ssn_lm} object, the cross validation error metrics are:
\itemize{
\item{bias: }{The average difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{std.bias: }{The average standardized difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{MSPE: }{The average squared difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{RMSPE: }{The root average squared difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{std.MSPE: }{The average standardized squared difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{RAV: }{The root of the average estimated variance of the predicted value}
\item{cor2: }{The squared correlation between the predicted and true values}
\item{cover.80: }{Coverage rates of 80\% prediction intervals built for the true values}
\item{cover.90: }{Coverage rates of 90\% prediction intervals built for the true values}
\item{cover.95: }{Coverage rates of 95\% prediction intervals built for the true values}
}

If an \code{ssn_glm} object, the cross validation error metrics are:
\itemize{
\item{bias: }{The average difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{MSPE: }{The average squared difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{RMSPE: }{The root average squared difference between the predicted value and true value}
\item{RAV: }{The root of the average estimated variance of the predicted value (on the link scale)}
}
}
\description{
Perform leave-one-out cross validation with options for computationally
efficient approximations for big data.
}
\details{
Each observation is held-out from the data set and the remaining data
are used to make a prediction for the held-out observation. This is compared
to the true value of the observation and several model-fit statistics are computed
across all observations.
