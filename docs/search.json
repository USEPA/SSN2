Peterson et al. 2013). addition, stream networks embedded within spatial environment, can also influence observations stream network. Traditional spatial statistical models, based solely Euclidean distance, often fail adequately describe unique complex spatial dependencies. Spatial stream network models based moving-average construction (J. M. Ver Hoef Peterson 2010) specifically designed describe two unique spatial relationships found streams data. pair sites considered flow-connected water flows upstream site downstream site. Sites flow-unconnected reside stream network (.e., share common junction downstream) share flow. Spatial stream network models typically rely two families covariance functions represent relationships: tail-tail-models. tail-model, moving-average function points upstream direction. Covariance function stream distance weighting structure used proportionally allocate, split, function upstream junctions account differences flow volume influential variables (Erin E. Peterson Ver Hoef 2010). result, non-zero covariances restricted flow-connected sites tail-model. tail-model, moving average function points downstream direction. contrast tail-model, tail-models allow flow-connected flow-unconnected autocorrelation, autocorrelation always equal stronger flow-unconnected sites flow-connected sites separated equal stream distances (J. M. Ver Hoef Peterson 2010). tail-model, covariance function stream distance weights required. However, also possible often preferable build spatial stream network models based mixture four components: tail-component, tail-component, Euclidean component, nugget component. Euclidean component useful captures covariance influential processes independent stream network intermediate broad scales (e.g., air temperature, soil type, geology). nugget component captures covariance processes highly localized, thus independent across sites. details regarding construction spatial stream network models covariance components, see Cressie et al. (2006), J. M. Ver Hoef, Peterson, Theobald (2006), J. M. Ver Hoef Peterson (2010), Erin E. Peterson Ver Hoef (2010), Isaak et al. (2014). SSN2 R package used fit summarize spatial stream network models make predictions unobserved locations (Kriging). SSN2 updated version SSN R package (J.

SSN2 depends sf instead rgdal, rgeos, maptools, reflecting broader change regarding handling spatial data R. See Nowosad (2023) information regarding retirement rgdal, rgeos, maptools, available link. features added SSN2 difficult implement SSN R package without massive restructuring foundation, new package created. example, SSN objects SSN2 S3 objects SSN objects SSN R package S4 objects.

Like semivariograms, Torgegram describes semivariance (.e. halved average squared difference) observations changes hydrologic Euclidean distances. strong dependence sites based flow-connected flow-unconnected relationships, semivariance increase respective distance. , however, strong dependence, semivariance relatively flat.

SSN models relate response variable one explanatory variables, spatially independent error term (.e., nugget), three spatially dependent error terms: tail-errors, tail-errors, Euclidean errors. Tail-errors restrict spatial dependence flow-connected sites (.e., water flows upstream downstream site) incorporate spatial weights (.e., additive function) describe branching network . Tail-errors describe spatial dependence flow-connected flow-unconnected (.e., sites share common downstream junction flow) sites, spatial weights required.
