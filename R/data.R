#' MiddleFork04.ssn: Middle Fork 2004 stream temperature dataset
#'
#' The \code{MiddleFork04.ssn} data folder contains the spatial, attribute,
#' and topological information needed to construct an SSN object using
#' the \code{SSN2} package.
#'
#' The \code{MiddleFork04.ssn} folder contains five geopackages:
#'
#' \itemize{
#'    \item edges: geopackage with LINESTRING geometry representing the stream network
#'    \item sites: geopackage with POINT geometry representing the observed site locations
#'    \item pred1km: geopackage with POINT geometry prediction site locations at
#'      approximately 1km intervals throughout the stream network
#'    \item Knapp: geopackage with POINT geometry representing prediction site locations on the Knapp River
#'    \item CapeHorn: geopackage with POINT geometry representing prediction site locations on the Cape Horn River
#' }
#'
#' The \code{MiddleFork04.ssn} includes two text files, \code{netID1.txt} and \code{netID2.txt}, which contain the
#' topological information for the two stream networks in the Middle Fork 2004
#' dataset.
#'
#' The distance folder contains four folders that store the hydrologic
#' distance matrices for each of the point datasets (\code{obs}, \code{CapeHorn},
#' \code{Knapp}, and \code{pred1km}). See [ssn_create_distmat()] for a
#' detailed description of the distance matrix file structure.
#'
#' Attribute data is also stored within each of the spatial
#' datasets. The column names are defined as follows:
#'
#'  \code{edges}:
#'   \itemize{
#'     \item rid: Reach identifier
#'     \item COMID: Common identifier of an NHD feature or relationship
#'     \item GNIS_Name: Feature name as found in the Geographic Names Information System
#'     \item REACHCODE: Unique identifier for a reach. The first 8 digits contain the identfier for the HUC8 and the last 6 digits are a unique within-HUC8 identifier for the reach
#'     \item FTYPE: three-digit integer used to classify hydrography features in the NHD and define subtypes
#'     \item FCODE: Numeric code that contains the feature type and its attributes as found in the NHDFCode lookup table

#'     \item C20: Number of times daily stream temperature exceeded 20C
#'     \item C24: Number of times daily stream temperature exceeded 24C

#'       by year, from 1950-2010 across 9 USGS gauges in the region
